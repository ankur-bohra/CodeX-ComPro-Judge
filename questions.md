> 1) In a list of elements of different data types, replace the elements occurring at even indexes(0 is included in the even set) with the ones occurring at odd indexes and vice versa, for reference: The value at the first even index(0) will be exchanged with the odd value following it, and similarly 2 with 3……(There are even number of elements in the list you need to sort this way)

Expected Input:
[12, “green”, 548.67, “Codex”, “156”, 23]

Expected Output:
['"green"', '12', '"Codex"', '548.67', '23', '"156"']


> 2) given two integers A and B, write a program to add these two numbers and output it.

Expected Input: 
"100 200"

Expected Output:
"300"


> 3) You have been given an array of size N consisting of integers. In addition you have been given an element M you need to find and print the index of the last occurrence of this element M in the array if it exists in it, otherwise print -1. Consider this array to be 1 indexed.

Input Format: The first line consists of 2 integers N and M denoting the size of the array and the element to be searched for in the array respectively . The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Output Format: Print a single integer denoting the index of the last occurrence of integer M in the array if it exists, otherwise print -1.

Sample Input:
5 1
1 2 3 4 1

Sample output:
5
